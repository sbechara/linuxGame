# Where did this come from?

Well, the `sprint.sh` file you ran uses the mv command to change a filename. Check the man page for mv to see if you can make sense of it. You can also type in `cat sprint.sh` to see the program that I wrote. Most of it might not make sense, just look for the line with the `mv` command.


## What does `mv` do?

In short, when you run the mv command you do it like this:
`mv <file you want to move> <where you want to move it to>`

The cool thing is, you can rename the file on the fly. So if you move a file to the same place that it already is but change it's name, that is all it will do.

## Sneaky sneaky...

In reality this file *was* available it was just *hidden*. In Linux, certain files are hidden from the user. You specify a hidden file by putting a `.` in front of the filename. So the file `relative_vs_absolute.md` is not hidden but the file `.relative_vs_absolute.md` is hidden. It is that simple! There are a bunch of reasons that you might want to hide a file from your user. Sometimes it is beacuse the file can break the system if it is edited! Other times, it is reserved for configuration files that would get in the way. For our purposes though, I just did it to be sneaky.

How can we see hidden files? Why don't you go to the `Woods` to see if you can find any hints there?
