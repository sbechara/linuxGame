# You found it!
You found the hidey place! I guess you win?

## A quick hint about navigation

Do a quick `pwd` to see where you currently are in the filesystem. You should see something like `/Users/yourname/linuxGame/Field/Woods/.hideyPlace/`. If you want to go back to the `linuxGame` folder you *could* type in `cd /Users/yourname/linuxGame` but sometimes it is nice just to go down one folder. In order to do that in linux you can use the shortcut `..`. So if I wanted to return to the `Woods/` folder I could type `cd ..` and it would take me back to that folder. If I wanted to go all the way back to the `linuxGame/` directory I could type in `cd ../../..` because that is the same as saying "go down three folders".

## Are you sure that you win?

Is there *really* nothing here though? How do you check to see if something is hidden? Maybe you should do that.
