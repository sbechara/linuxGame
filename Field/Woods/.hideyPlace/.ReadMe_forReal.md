# The REAL ReadMe

You found it! This is the *real* ReadMe. Remember, most of the time, the best way to use `ls` is to specify the options `-al`. That way you can see everything in the directory AND it is easy to tell what is a folder and what is a file.

## Try running .sneakyProgram.sh

Now that you can see it, run `.sneakyProgram.sh`. What is it telling you?

## Removing Files

You will notice that there is a cheat file in this directory! Obviously you aren't a cheater so go ahead and remove the file. Don't remember how? That is ok, go back to the original "ReadMe" file to get a hint.

Once you get rid of that pesky cheat file, run `.sneakyProgram.sh` again. It still isn't working?

## Touching Files

Sometimes, it is nice to be able to create a file on the fly (even if there is nothing in it yet). You can create files with any extension you would like by specifying the name and extension as an input to the `touch` command. For example, if I wanted to create a file called `awesome.txt` in the current directory, I could do so by typing `touch awesome.txt`.

So what do you need to touch? Try to figure it out and re-run `.sneakyProgram.sh`.
