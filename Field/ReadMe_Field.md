# Welcome to the Field

## What do you need to do?
You need to run some programs (either `jog.sh` or `sprint.sh`), but one of the programs is a virus and the other one is the one you want to run. Don't delete anything just yet but check them both out by "concatenating or printing" each file to see what it says! 

When you are confident you know which one is NOT a virus, you can run it by typing the command `sh <filename.sh>`
