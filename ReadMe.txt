# Linux Learning Game
By: Samuel Bechara

## About
This was made by me, I am probably walking around the room right now weirding you out. Or maybe you are an online student. In either way, I hope you learn a little, and have a little fun.

## The first rule, everything is a file or a folder
That is it! Super important that you never forget what you are dealing with. A file is a thing (a picture, a word document, a video) and a folder is a place that files can live in. Everything is a file, and it has to live in a folder. Remember, that and you are halfway to being a linux expert! But the other half is kind of hard, but still! Halfway there!

## man - talk to the man!
I mean that on linux systems, if you forget what something does, you can read the manual! I'll admit that it is pretty archaic and hard to understand, but the more you read them the more sense they make.

## Basic Commands
cd - change directory
touch - create a file
ls - list files in directory
cat - print out the contents of a file
mkdir - make a directory
rm - remove a file

## First things first
Learn all about the previous commands by typing man <command> and reading. You press the letter 'q' on your keyboard to quit the man program. Once you have read a little about each of those commands, go ahead and go to the field. You can go through the door if you want, but I don't think there is anything there...
